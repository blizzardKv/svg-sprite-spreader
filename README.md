# svg-sprite-spreader

If in any case you need to get sprite-item name and sizes:

- add file to read
- run in terminal `node ./runSpread.js ${filePath} ${endcoding}`
- where ${filePath} - **relative** path to file (string type), ${encoding} - your encode type (utf-8 by default)
- your output - Markdown table - will be in root folder when the script done
